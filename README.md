## Workshops on using cfhighlander

### ECS + Nginx

Goal of this workshop is to create VPC with both private and
public subnets, and deploy bastion and ecs components into these
subnets. Additionally, ECS cluster is deployed with single nginx
service.

More advanced users can try and deploy custom built image to ECR,
and then configure ECS service component to use it.
